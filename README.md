## Overview

Front-End challenge for [GoParity](https://www.goparity.com) - November 2022

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to showcase my front-end development skills and highlight my ability to learn different languages and frameworks.

## Approach

First, I went through the Vue documentation and watched some tutorial videos to familiarize myself with a new framework. I used Vite for a quick set up of my development environment and Axios to facilitate the consumption of [Pok√©Api](https://pokeapi.co/). After identifying what information I wanted to display, I designed a classic pokecard to populate with reactive data based on the species and type of the randomly generated pokemon.

## Technologies and Tools

- JavaScript
- VueJS
- HTML
- CSS
- Vite
- Axios

## Install and Setup

To run this app locally:

1. Run `git clone git@github.com:mcfrann/ww-takehome.git` in your command line
2. Run `cd pokeProject` to navigate into the repository
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Up Next

Moving forward I plan to carry on with the project:
  - further familiarize myself with Vue features and syntax to achieve more elegant and effective code
  - fix the issue with the delayed display of data regarding the type and power of the selected move
  - refactor for more DRY code
  - continued improvement of styling
  - create buttons to display the different stages of evolution of any randomly generated Pokemon
